//meant to test vectors, std::size_t
//from outside research, std::size_t should be used in basically every place that will be used as an index.
//it is a consistency as well as a security thing in larger programs.
//this program will take in space delimited integers and sort them with a simple bubble sort

//make sure that you include vector when you will actually be using it.
