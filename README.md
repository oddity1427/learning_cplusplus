learning c++ via https://github.com/jesyspa/linear-cpp.git I will be compiling all of the programs found in the various chapters as well as creating example programs for each chapter to make sure that I understand and can implement the concepts. Because I have a good OOP background already, most of these example programs should be non-exhaustive, and just to make sure that I have a good understanding of all of the syntax and new-to-me features. This will serve as a baseline of knowlede for more complicated projects to come.

As the purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with how c++ works so I could create my own project, the chapters relating to the interpreter were skipped as far as me writing examples. As the complexity of the interpreter progressed, it became more and more clear that the best way to write an example that would demonstrate the concepts would be to work on an entirely different project. Creating an interpreter/compiler myself seems like a pretty interesting project, but one that I would need spicifically different syntax or requirements to make meaningfully different from this one. This has been fun and informative, and I only wish that the original repo had been continued.
