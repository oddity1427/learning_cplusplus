learning c++ via https://github.com/jesyspa/linear-cpp.git I will be compiling all of the programs found in the various chapters as well as creating example programs for each chapter to make sure that I understand and can implement the concepts. Because I have a good OOP background already, most of these example programs should be non-exhaustive, and just to make sure that I have a good understanding of all of the syntax and new-to-me features. This will serve as a baseline of knowlede for more complicated projects to come.
